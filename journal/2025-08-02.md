Start of this project:

Objective: As of this date, the goal for this is to create an algorithm that can distinguish champions by their in-game model. The program would run in the background as an overlay. Upon seeing the champion in game, the overlay will show a brief overview of the champion's skills with details like mana costs, cooldowns by level, and more. 

The first step for this project is to build a model that is simply able to recognize the specific in-game image of a champion.

~~Image data for each champion is to be taken from youtube videos showing off default models of the respective champions.~~

~~Was initially using full skin spotlights of champions, but changed this to shorter videos of default_models.~~

There is no YouTube showcases of default skins. Will have to record my own footage for this.
